	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called Time complexity  of the algorithm. The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the Time complexity.</p>
    <p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. For example, if we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis of space, then Auxiliary Space would be a better criterion than <b>Space Complexity</b>. Merge Sort uses O(n) auxiliary space, Insertion sort, and Heap Sort use O(1) auxiliary space. The <b>Space Complexity</b> of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though. </p>
